# Titanic-Kaggle-Machine-Learning-Entry
This is a Jupyter Notebook of the Titanic Kaggle Machine Learning Competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic 

This notebook is exploratory data analysis of the features in the Titanic data set.

We wrangle the data into a format for machine learning models and run Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, 
Linear Support Vector Machines (SVC), Stochastic Gradient Descent, Decision Tree Classifier, and finally Catboost. 

We then analyze the most important features to our best model and create a submission file to Kaggle.
